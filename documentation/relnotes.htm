			Version 11.10 takes advantage of the technological advancements provided by Barista&reg; and BBj&reg; to deliver an innovative software package known for its structural quality. Together with Barista, Version 11.10 offers a leap forward in the efficiency of software customization and the creation of vertical applications. AddonSoftware
continues its 25-year history of constant improvement - additional features, increased functionality, and updated technology - in this release.
			<ul>
			<li>New for version 11.10
			<br />
				<ul>
				<li>Three new graphical reports have been added to the Accounts Receivable => Reports menu. These reports are all graphical, but each one takes a different approach, demonstrating how you can harness the power of BBj, java and JasperReports. </li>
					<ul>
						<li>Graphic Sales Report by Salesperson: presents a graphical representation of sales data for a selectable period by Salesperson in 6 different graphic formats. This is a straight BBj program, arr_graphicSalesReport.aon.</li>
						<li>Sales Digital Dashboard: presents sales data for a selected month in several different formats by Salesperson, Customer Type and Year-to-Date sales. This program, arr_digitalDashboard.src, was created using AppBuilder.</li>
						<li>Drill Down Sales Report by Customer Type: presents a series of reports starting with Sales By Customer type for a selectable period. The user can click on a customer type and see the sales by customer within that customer type. Clicking on a customer drills down to a report of invoices for that customer. Clicking on an invoice drills down to the invoice line items. The reports are linked, allowing the user to move up and down the drill-down stack. The lead-in is a straight BBj program that provides for selecting the period, and all the reports are done with Jasper iReports. The lead-in program also allows the user to select data and enter the drill-down stack at a lower level. This report uses BBj Stored Procedures (SPROCS), providing a glimpse into how to work with SPROCs as well.</li>
					</ul>				
                <li>Completed BBj Trigger definition and source files to facilitate running a hybrid version of Addon Payroll.  See the readme.txt in the <install>/apps/aon/util/v6triggers/ folder for more information. </li>
                <li>Improved GL Financial Reports and Purchase Order Receipt Register to use DocOut formatting.</li>
                <li>Developer/VAR utility to increment all of the year fields in demo data. Accessible only via the Form Manager => ADX_DEMOYEAR.</li>
                <li>Enhanced AR Invoice drilldown in Customer Master that takes advantage of Barista drilldown filtering capability to display only open invoices.</li>
                <li>The AddonSoftware Installation and Upgrade Wizard (AIUW) automates the install and upgrade process, eliminating manual copy/pasting and configuration file edits. All of these programs are located in the AddonSoftware Administration => Utilities => Install/Upgrade Utilities menu. </li>
					<ul>
                        <li>Graphical Front-end to the AIUW for new Addon Installations: For new Addon installations, the Install Wizard saves time by consolidating the Copy aon Directory, Update addon.syn File, and Update sync XML Files utilities into one seamless step.</li>                    
						<li>Copy aon Directory: Copies the aon directory from the download location to a specified new location.</li>
						<li>Update addon.syn File: Updates paths in the specified .syn file to reflect the new aon location and location of data files.</li>
						<li>Update sync XML Files: Recovers administrative data (masks, messages, sequence numbers, etc.) previously backed up into the sync directory, and updates paths in admin_modules*.xml files to the new location.</li>
                        <li>Copy Custom Modifications: Recursively copies specified application/project file structures used to store Addon customizations in order to re-install the customizations into a new/upgraded Addon.</li>
                        <li>Distribute EM Update Wizard Files: Moves files converted during the EM Update wizard to their proper application data location and clears unneeded files.</li>
                <li>Parameterized control over Totals tab in Order/Invoice Entry: A new field in the Sales Order Processing parameters provides control over whether or not users are warned or focus is forced onto the Totals tab to re-evaluate Freight and Discount amounts when changing existing line items.</li>
					</ul>
				</ul>
